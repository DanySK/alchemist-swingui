/**
 * A Wormhole (in this context) is an entity that "connects" two worlds: the
 * "environment" and the "view". Above all it provides services to convert
 * coordinates from the "environment-space" to the "view-space".
 * <code>IWormhole2D</code> is the type of a wormhole whose both environment and
 * view are bi-dimensional spaces. <br>
 * <br>
 * <strong>Terminology:</strong> <br>
 * <br>
 * - "Environment" is the 'rectangle' we need to render ON the view.<br>
 * - "View" is a 'window' that let us see the environment.<br>
 * - "Environment-space" is the algebraic space on which 'lies' the environment.<br>
 * - "View-space" is the algebraic space on which 'lies' the view.<br>
 * - "Env" before a point's name => it refers to a point into the
 * environment-space.<br>
 * - "View" before a point's name => it refers to a point into the view-space.<br>
 * - "Position" is the point of the view-space every transformation applied to
 * the environment refers to: e.g. if I want to move the environment, I have to
 * change the position; it is also the point the environment rotates around.<br>
 * - "EnvOffset" is the vector from (0; 0) into env-space to the left-bottom
 * corner of the part of the environment we want to render. E.g. if I am
 * representing a map with Earth-coordinates (16; 48), the intersection between
 * the prime meridian and the equator is (0; 0), so I have to set the envOffset
 * to (16; 48) in order to see the "beginning" of the map on the left-bottom
 * corner of the view.<br>
